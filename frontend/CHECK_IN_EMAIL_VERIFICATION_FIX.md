# Check-In Email Verification Redirect Bug Fix

## Issue Summary

Check-in links from reminder emails were incorrectly redirecting users to the email verification page (`/auth/verify-email`) instead of allowing them to check in successfully.

**Affected URL Pattern**: `https://staging.keyfate.com/check-in?token=xxx`

## Root Cause

The middleware had two layers of authentication:
1. **Session-based authentication** - Checking if user has valid session
2. **Email verification check** - Ensuring authenticated users have verified emails

The bug occurred because:
- `/check-in` was correctly added to `publicRoutes` (allowing unauthenticated access) ✓
- `/api/check-in` was correctly exempted from session auth ✓
- **BUT** `/check-in` was missing from `verificationExemptRoutes` ✗

### What Happened
1. User clicked email link: `/check-in?token=xxx`
2. If user had an old session cookie AND unverified email:
   - Middleware allowed access (public route)
   - Then checked email verification status
   - Since `/check-in` wasn't in `verificationExemptRoutes`, it redirected to `/auth/verify-email`

This was incorrect because check-in uses **token-based authentication** (via the query parameter), not session-based authentication, so email verification should not be required.

## Solution

Added `/check-in` to the `verificationExemptRoutes` array in `src/middleware.ts`:

```typescript
const verificationExemptRoutes = [
  "/auth/verify-email",
  "/auth/verify-email-nextauth",
  "/api/auth/verify-email",
  "/api/auth/verify-email-nextauth",
  "/api/auth/resend-verification",
  "/api/auth/verification-status",
  "/sign-in",
  "/auth/signup",
  "/auth/error",
  "/check-in", // Token-based authentication, not session-based
];
```

## Files Changed

1. **src/middleware.ts** - Added `/check-in` to `verificationExemptRoutes`
2. **__tests__/auth/check-in-route-access.test.ts** - Added regression test
3. **docs/check-in-authentication.md** - Updated documentation

## Testing

### New Regression Test
Added test case: "should not require email verification for check-in page (token-based auth)"

This test simulates:
- Authenticated user with `emailVerified: false`
- Accessing `/check-in?token=xxx`
- Verifies: Should NOT redirect to `/auth/verify-email`

### Test Results
```bash
✓ __tests__/auth/check-in-route-access.test.ts (11 tests) 142ms
  All tests passed
```

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Setup**: Have a user account with unverified email and active session
2. **Action**: Click a check-in link from a reminder email
3. **Expected**: User sees the check-in page with "Check In Now" button
4. **Previous Bug**: User was redirected to email verification page

## Related Documentation

- Check-in authentication flow: `docs/check-in-authentication.md`
- Middleware configuration: `src/middleware.ts`
- Test coverage: `__tests__/auth/check-in-route-access.test.ts`

## Impact

- **Severity**: High - Prevented users from checking in via email links
- **Affected Users**: Users with unverified emails who had active sessions
- **User Experience**: Check-in links now work correctly for all users

## Prevention

The regression test added in this fix will prevent this issue from recurring. The test explicitly checks that authenticated users with unverified emails can still access the check-in page.

## Commit Message

```
fix: allow check-in page access for users with unverified emails

Check-in uses token-based auth from the URL query parameter, not
session-based auth, so email verification should not be required.

Added /check-in to verificationExemptRoutes in middleware to prevent
redirect to email verification page when users click check-in links.

- Updated middleware.ts with verification exempt route
- Added regression test for authenticated + unverified scenario
- Updated documentation with verification bypass details

Fixes issue where reminder email links redirected to verify-email
instead of allowing check-in.
