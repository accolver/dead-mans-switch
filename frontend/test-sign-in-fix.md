# Sign-In Error Fix Verification

## Problem Fixed
The sign-in form was redirecting users when they entered an incorrect password, preventing them from seeing the error message and trying again.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed overly complex navigation guard logic** that was interfering with proper error display
2. **Simplified the `handleCredentialsSignIn` function** to focus on core functionality
3. **Maintained `redirect: false`** to prevent NextAuth from redirecting on authentication failure
4. **Ensured error state persists** on the sign-in page for user feedback

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test Case 1: Incorrect Password
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/sign-in`
2. Enter a valid email (e.g., `test@example.com`)
3. Enter an incorrect password
4. Click "Sign in"
5. **Expected Result**:
   - Error message displays: "Invalid email or password. Please try again."
   - User stays on `/sign-in` page (no redirect)
   - User can immediately try again

### Test Case 2: Correct Password
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/sign-in`
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Click "Sign in"
4. **Expected Result**:
   - User is redirected to home page or callback URL
   - No error message displays

### Test Case 3: Network Error
1. Disconnect network or cause authentication service failure
2. Try to sign in
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Error message: "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again."
   - User stays on `/sign-in` page

## Code Changes Made

### File: `/src/app/sign-in/page.tsx`

#### Removed:
- Complex navigation guard useEffect (lines ~107-177)
- URL manipulation and redirect prevention logic
- `json: true` parameter in signIn call
- Extensive pathname checking and history manipulation

#### Simplified:
- `handleCredentialsSignIn` function now has clean error handling
- Direct error state management without URL parameter conflicts
- Straightforward success/failure flow

#### Maintained:
- `redirect: false` parameter to prevent NextAuth redirects
- Error message mapping with `getNextAuthErrorMessage`
- Loading states and user feedback
- Proper form validation

## Test Results
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Error handling tests updated and verified
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Simplified codebase with improved maintainability

## Benefits of This Fix
1. **Better UX**: Users see clear error messages without confusing redirects
2. **Simpler Code**: Removed ~70 lines of complex navigation guard logic
3. **More Reliable**: Less prone to race conditions and browser inconsistencies
4. **Maintainable**: Easier to understand and modify in the future
