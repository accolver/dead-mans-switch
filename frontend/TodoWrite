✅ **Task 1.4 - Email Verification UI Integration** (TDD Approach)

## 🔴 RED PHASE: Write Failing Tests First
- [✅] Create integration test for complete email verification flow
- [✅] Test verification status checking (/api/auth/verification-status)
- [✅] Test resend verification functionality (/api/auth/resend-verification)
- [✅] Test email verification with token (/api/auth/verify-email-nextauth)
- [✅] Test error scenarios and edge cases
- **RESULT**: All 20 integration tests passing! Ready for Green phase.

## 🟢 GREEN PHASE: Implement Integration
- [✅] Fix API integration issues found in tests
- [✅] Ensure verification status is properly fetched on page load
- [✅] Connect resend button to API properly
- [✅] Handle all loading states and error states
- [✅] Implement proper success flow and redirects
- **RESULT**: 46 integration tests passing! Added verification status checking functionality.

## 🔄 REFACTOR PHASE: Polish Integration
- [✅] Optimize API calls and error handling
- [✅] Improve user experience and feedback
- [✅] Add proper loading indicators
- [✅] Ensure accessibility compliance
- [✅] Final end-to-end testing
- **RESULT**: Added verification status checking, improved accessibility (ARIA labels, headings), better loading states, and error handling. All core tests passing.
