# Email Template Visual Output

This directory contains generated HTML email samples for visual testing and verification.

## Purpose

The files in this directory are generated by running the visual rendering tests:

```bash
npm test -- __tests__/lib/email/email-visual-rendering.test.ts --run
```

## Generated Files

- `verification-email.html` - Email verification template sample
- `reminder-email-high-urgency.html` - High urgency check-in reminder
- `disclosure-email.html` - Secret disclosure email with security warnings
- `custom-base-email.html` - Base template with custom content
- `long-content-email.html` - Long content handling test

## How to Review

1. Open the HTML files in a web browser to see desktop rendering
2. Use browser developer tools to test responsive/mobile views
3. Test in different email clients if possible:
   - Gmail (web and mobile)
   - Outlook (desktop and web)
   - Apple Mail
   - Other major email clients

## Max-Width Constraint

All emails are constrained to **600px maximum width** for optimal email client compatibility and professional appearance. This is implemented using:

- Table-based layout for maximum email client compatibility
- Centered content using `align="center"` on table cells
- Responsive padding that adapts to mobile screens
- Inline styles for critical layout properties

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Desktop view: Email is centered with 600px max-width
- [ ] Mobile view: Email is full-width with proper padding
