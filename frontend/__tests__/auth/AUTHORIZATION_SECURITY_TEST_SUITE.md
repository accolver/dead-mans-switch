# Authorization Security Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This comprehensive authorization security test suite validates the application's security posture using a penetration testing mindset. The suite contains **22 security-focused tests** organized into **7 major security domains**.

## Test Philosophy

**Penetration Testing Mindset:**
- Assume attackers will try every possible attack vector
- Test all protected endpoints for authorization bypass vulnerabilities
- Verify user ownership validation at every layer
- Ensure no information leakage in error responses
- Test session management and token security thoroughly

## Test Coverage Matrix

### 1. Cross-User Secret Access Prevention (6 tests)

**Attack Vector:** Unauthorized access to other users' secrets

**Tests:**
- ✅ Prevent User A from accessing User B's secret (GET)
- ✅ Prevent sequential ID enumeration attacks
- ✅ Prevent timing attacks that leak secret existence
- ✅ Prevent User A from deleting User B's secret (DELETE)
- ✅ Prevent User A from updating User B's secret (PUT)

**Security Measures Validated:**
- User ownership verification on all operations
- Consistent error responses (404, not 403) to avoid information leakage
- Service-level authorization checks
- No difference in response timing for existing vs. non-existing secrets

### 2. Session Hijacking Prevention (4 tests)

**Attack Vector:** Session manipulation and forged authentication

**Tests:**
- ✅ Reject requests without session
- ✅ Reject requests with malformed session (missing user)
- ✅ Reject requests with malformed session (missing user ID)
- ✅ Validate session for all HTTP methods (GET, DELETE, PUT)

**Security Measures Validated:**
- Session existence validation
- Session structure validation
- Consistent authentication across all endpoints
- Proper 401 Unauthorized responses

### 3. Token Manipulation and Injection Attacks (2 tests)

**Attack Vector:** SQL injection, XSS, and payload injection

**Tests:**
- ✅ Sanitize secret IDs to prevent SQL injection
- ✅ Prevent XSS attacks in secret metadata

**Security Measures Validated:**
- Input sanitization
- Parameter validation
- Safe handling of malicious payloads
- Protection against common injection vectors:
  - SQL injection: `'; DROP TABLE secrets; --`
  - XSS: `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
  - Path traversal: `../../../etc/passwd`

### 4. Privilege Escalation Prevention (2 tests)

**Attack Vector:** Unauthorized privilege elevation

**Tests:**
- ✅ Enforce user ID from session, not request body (CREATE)
- ✅ Prevent userId modification through update (UPDATE)

**Security Measures Validated:**
- Session-based user ID enforcement
- Request body validation (userId ignored)
- Authorization layer integrity
- No trust of client-provided ownership data

### 5. Boundary Conditions and Edge Cases (4 tests)

**Attack Vector:** Malformed input and edge cases

**Tests:**
- ✅ Handle empty secret ID
- ✅ Handle extremely long secret IDs (10KB)
- ✅ Handle special characters in secret IDs
- ✅ Handle null and undefined values gracefully

**Security Measures Validated:**
- Input validation
- Length limits
- Special character handling
- Graceful error handling (400, 404, 414, 500)

### 6. Attack Vector Prevention (4 tests)

**Attack Vector:** Advanced attack techniques

**Tests:**
- ✅ Prevent race condition attacks on secret access
- ✅ Prevent information disclosure through error messages
- ✅ Prevent parameter pollution attacks
- ✅ Validate content-type header to prevent MIME confusion

**Security Measures Validated:**
- Concurrent request handling
- Generic error messages (no stack traces, queries, or internal details)
- Parameter deduplication
- Content-type validation
- No sensitive information leakage

### 7. Security Logging and Monitoring (1 test)

**Attack Vector:** Lack of security event visibility

**Tests:**
- ✅ Log unauthorized access attempts for security monitoring

**Security Measures Validated:**
- Security event logging
- Audit trail creation
- Attack detection capability
- Forensic analysis support

## Test Results

```
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests       22 passed (22)
Duration    34ms
```

All 22 authorization security tests pass successfully.

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified and Validated

### Prevented Attack Vectors:
1. ✅ Cross-user secret access (all CRUD operations)
2. ✅ ID enumeration attacks
3. ✅ Timing-based information leakage
4. ✅ Session hijacking
5. ✅ SQL injection
6. ✅ XSS attacks
7. ✅ Privilege escalation
8. ✅ Parameter pollution
9. ✅ Path traversal
10. ✅ Race conditions
11. ✅ MIME confusion
12. ✅ Information disclosure

### Security Best Practices Enforced:
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ User ownership validation
- ✅ Input sanitization
- ✅ Generic error messages
- ✅ Consistent response timing
- ✅ Authorization at service layer
- ✅ Graceful error handling

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run authorization security tests only
npm test -- __tests__/auth/authorization-security.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage __tests__/auth/authorization-security.test.ts

# Run in watch mode for development
npm test -- --watch __tests__/auth/authorization-security.test.ts
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Tests:
1. **Rate Limiting:** Test API rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
2. **CSRF Protection:** Validate CSRF token implementation
3. **JWT Token Validation:** Test token expiration, signature validation
4. **Role-Based Access Control:** Test admin-only endpoints (if implemented)
5. **File Upload Security:** Test file upload validation and sanitization
6. **API Key Security:** Test API key rotation and revocation

### Recommended Security Additions:
1. Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
2. Add request rate limiting
3. Implement audit logging for all security events
4. Add intrusion detection alerts
5. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD

## Integration with CI/CD

This test suite should run on:
- Every pull request
- Every commit to main branch
- Nightly security scans
- Before production deployments

**Required Pass Rate:** 100% (all tests must pass)

## Security Contact

For security vulnerabilities discovered through these tests:
- File a security issue in the repository
- Contact the security team immediately
- Do not disclose publicly until patched

## Compliance

This test suite helps validate compliance with:
- OWASP Top 10 security risks
- Common Web Application Security standards
- API security best practices
- Data protection requirements
