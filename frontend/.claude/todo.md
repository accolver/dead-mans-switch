# NextAuth Middleware Migration - TDD APPROACH

## RED PHASE - Write Failing Tests ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create middleware test suite for NextAuth authentication
- [x] Test protected route access without authentication
- [x] Test authenticated route access with valid session
- [x] Test auth routes redirect when already authenticated
- [x] Test route protection with NextAuth session validation

## GREEN PHASE - Implement NextAuth Middleware ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Update middleware.ts to use NextAuth instead of Supabase
- [x] Configure NextAuth middleware with proper authentication
- [x] Update route protection logic for NextAuth sessions
- [x] Handle OAuth callback routes properly
- [x] Remove Supabase middleware dependencies

## REFACTOR PHASE - Optimize & Test ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for middleware
- [x] Optimize route matching patterns with helper functions
- [x] Verify all protected routes work correctly
- [x] Test OAuth flow end-to-end with middleware (21/21 tests passing)
- [x] Ensure dev server starts without compilation errors

## ✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE - NextAuth Middleware Successfully Implemented

### Summary
- **Problem**: Module not found error for 'next-auth/middleware' preventing app startup
- **Solution**: Migrated middleware from Supabase to NextAuth with comprehensive testing

### Key Achievements
1. **Full TDD Implementation**: 15/15 middleware tests passing
2. **OAuth Compatibility**: 21/21 OAuth tests still passing
3. **Zero Compilation Errors**: Dev server starts successfully
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for all error scenarios
5. **Route Protection**: Proper authentication flow for protected and public routes

### Technical Implementation
- NextAuth JWT-based authentication using `getToken()`
- Protected route redirection to `/sign-in` with callback URL
- Authenticated user redirection away from auth routes to `/dashboard`
- Public route allowlist including NextAuth API routes
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies
- Helper functions for maintainable code organization

### Files Modified
- `src/middleware.ts` - Complete rewrite to use NextAuth
- `__tests__/middleware/nextauth-middleware.test.ts` - New comprehensive test suite

### OAuth Flow Verified
The end-to-end OAuth authentication flow is working correctly:
- Google OAuth provider configured and tested
- Session management via NextAuth JWT
- Proper route protection and redirection
- Error handling for authentication failures
