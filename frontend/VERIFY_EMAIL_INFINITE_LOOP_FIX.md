# Verify Email Page Infinite Loop Fix

## Issue Summary

After logging in, users were redirected to `/auth/verify-email` and got stuck on an infinite "Loading..." screen, breaking the entire authentication flow.

**Affected Route**: `/auth/verify-email`

## Root Cause

The `useEffect` hook in `EmailVerificationPageNextAuth` component had a dependency array issue that caused an infinite re-render loop:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
useEffect(() => {
  if (token && email) {
    handleTokenVerification(token, email)
  } else if (status === "authenticated" && (session?.user as any)?.id) {
    checkVerificationStatus()
  } else {
    setChecking(false)
  }
}, [token, email, status, (session?.user as any)?.id]) // ❌ PROBLEM: (session?.user as any)?.id changes every render
```

### Why This Caused an Infinite Loop

1. Component renders
2. `useEffect` runs because `(session?.user as any)?.id` is in dependency array
3. `checkVerificationStatus()` is called
4. Session object reference changes (even if values are the same)
5. `useEffect` detects dependency change
6. Loop repeats infinitely
7. User stuck on "Checking verification status..." forever

## Solution

Removed the problematic `(session?.user as any)?.id` from the dependency array and improved the conditional logic:

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
useEffect(() => {
  if (token && email) {
    handleTokenVerification(token, email)
  } else if (status === "authenticated" && (session?.user as any)?.id) {
    checkVerificationStatus()
  } else if (status === "unauthenticated") {
    setChecking(false)
  } else if (status === "loading") {
    // Still loading session, keep checking state
    return
  } else {
    setChecking(false)
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [token, email, status]) // ✅ FIXED: Only stable dependencies
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed unstable dependency**: `(session?.user as any)?.id` removed from array
2. **Added status handling**: Explicitly handle `"loading"`, `"authenticated"`, and `"unauthenticated"` states
3. **Added ESLint disable**: Acknowledged that we're intentionally not including all dependencies
4. **Improved logic**: Better conditional flow for different session states

## Files Changed

1. **src/components/auth/email-verification-page-nextauth.tsx** - Fixed useEffect dependency array

## Testing

The component should now:
- ✅ Check verification status once when authenticated
- ✅ Handle token verification when token is present
- ✅ Redirect unauthenticated users to sign-in
- ✅ Show loading state only during initial session loading
- ✅ Not enter infinite render loops

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Login**: Sign in with an account that has unverified email
2. **Redirect**: Should be redirected to `/auth/verify-email`
3. **Page Load**: Page should load completely (not stuck on "Loading...")
4. **See Content**: Should see "Verify your email address" with email and resend button
5. **Previous Bug**: Page was stuck showing "Checking verification status..."

## Technical Details

### React useEffect Dependency Rules

React's `useEffect` hook reruns when any dependency in the dependency array changes. The problem was:

```typescript
(session?.user as any)?.id
```

This creates a new reference every render because:
1. `session` object may be recreated by NextAuth
2. `(session?.user as any)` creates a new object reference
3. Even if the ID value is the same, the reference is different
4. React sees it as a "change" and reruns the effect

### Solution Pattern

The fix follows React best practices:
1. Only include **stable** dependencies (primitive values like strings)
2. Use `status` instead of `session?.user?.id` since `status` is a stable string
3. Access `session?.user?.id` inside the effect condition (not in dependency array)
4. Add ESLint disable comment to acknowledge intentional deviation

- Email verification component: `src/components/auth/email-verification-page-nextauth.tsx`
- Verification status API: `src/app/api/auth/verification-status/route.ts`

## Impact

- **Severity**: Critical - Completely broke authentication flow for all users
- **Affected Users**: 100% of users trying to log in
- **User Experience**: Users can now complete email verification flow

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. Always review `useEffect` dependency arrays carefully
2. Avoid object property access in dependency arrays
3. Use primitive values (strings, numbers) as dependencies when possible
4. Test authentication flows thoroughly before deployment

## Commit Message

```
fix: resolve infinite loop on email verification page

The email verification page was stuck in an infinite render loop
due to an unstable dependency in the useEffect hook. The session
object reference changed on every render, causing the effect to
run continuously.

Removed (session?.user as any)?.id from dependency array and
improved conditional logic to handle different session states
explicitly. Now only depends on stable primitive values.

- Fixed useEffect dependency array to use only stable dependencies
- Added explicit handling for loading/authenticated/unauthenticated states
- Added ESLint disable comment for intentional dependency omission

Fixes critical bug where users got stuck on "Checking verification
status..." after logging in.
