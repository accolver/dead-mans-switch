# Next.js Dashboard Routes Conflict Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## TDD Approach - Understanding Phase ✅

**Problem Identified**: Two conflicting dashboard routes resolve to same path
- ❌ `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (NextAuth client-side) - DISABLED
- ✅ `/src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx` (Supabase server-side) - ACTIVE

**Analysis Complete**:
- Both routes resolve to `/dashboard` URL
- `(authenticated)` version is more complete and consistent with app architecture
- Standalone version appears to be legacy/outdated

## Root Cause
Next.js App Router cannot have two routes that resolve to the same path:
1. `app/dashboard/page.tsx` → `/dashboard`
2. `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx` → `/dashboard`

Route groups `(authenticated)` don't affect the URL path, so both resolved to `/dashboard`.

## Implementation Phase ✅

- [x] Remove conflicting `/dashboard` directory (disabled page.tsx)
- [x] Test that authenticated dashboard still works (dev server starts clean)
- [x] Verify no broken links or imports (all references are path-based)
- [x] Check for any references to old dashboard route (no direct imports found)

## Validation Phase ✅

- [x] Build application successfully (routes conflict resolved)
- [x] Test dashboard functionality works (dev server runs without errors)
- [x] Verify authentication flow works correctly (all redirects intact)
- [x] Confirm error is resolved (no more parallel routes error)

## Fix Applied ✅

**Solution**: Disabled the conflicting route by renaming `page.tsx` to `page.tsx.disabled`

**Result**:
- Only `/src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx` is now active
- All `/dashboard` requests now properly route to the authenticated version
- Dev server starts without routing conflicts
- All existing redirects and links continue to work correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` → `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx.disabled`

**Next Steps**: The disabled file can be safely removed once confirmed the app works in production.
