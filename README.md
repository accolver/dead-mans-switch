Your key to peace of mind.

A secure digital service that automatically triggers an alarm or other emergency response when the user is incapacitated.

A user is required to check in with the app at a regular interval to keep the switch from triggering. If they fail to check in by the secret's configured interval, the secret will be marked as triggered and the configured actions will be taken. This typically involves sending an SMS or email to a trusted contact.
