			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Complete Email Verification System Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down email verification system into: 1) Configure email settings and OTP verification, 2) Fix Google OAuth email_verified flag implementation, 3) Update middleware to enforce email verification, 4) Create email verification UI components and flows, 5) Implement email verification status management, 6) Add comprehensive testing for all verification flows",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to OAuth integration, middleware updates, and UI components. Existing auth structure and middleware present but email verification not properly implemented. Multiple integration points require careful testing."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Production SMTP Configuration and Email Delivery Setup",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure SMTP implementation as: 1) Configure production SMTP provider (SendGrid/Mailgun/AWS SES), 2) Create email templates for reminders and notifications, 3) Implement email delivery monitoring and retry logic, 4) Set up SPF/DKIM email authentication, 5) Handle bounce/complaint processing and batch limits",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving third-party SMTP integration, email authentication setup, and monitoring. Existing email functions present but need production-grade configuration."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Complete Stripe and BTCPay Webhook Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize payment webhook completion into: 1) Complete Stripe webhook handlers for all subscription events, 2) Implement BTCPay webhook processing for Bitcoin payments, 3) Add subscription status synchronization with database, 4) Implement webhook signature verification, 5) Add error handling and retry logic for failed webhooks, 6) Update user tier management based on payment events, 7) Handle edge cases (partial payments, refunds, chargebacks)",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to dual payment provider integration, complex webhook handling, and financial data integrity requirements. Extensive BTCPay integration documentation exists but webhook implementation incomplete."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend Payment Flow Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure frontend payment integration as: 1) Connect StripeCheckoutButton and BTCPayCheckoutButton to backend APIs, 2) Complete billing portal session management, 3) Implement real-time subscription status updates, 4) Add payment success/failure handling with user feedback, 5) Complete UserPricingActions component integration, 6) Add usage limit enforcement based on subscription tier",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity requiring frontend-backend integration, real-time updates, and user experience considerations. Payment components partially exist but need full integration."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Production Infrastructure Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down infrastructure deployment into: 1) Deploy staging environment to Google Cloud Run, 2) Configure SSL certificates and custom domain, 3) Set up production database with backups, 4) Configure monitoring and alerting (Cloud Monitoring, Sentry), 5) Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments, 6) Configure environment variables and secrets management, 7) Set up log aggregation and monitoring, 8) Deploy production environment with blue/green deployment",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive infrastructure setup, monitoring integration, and production readiness requirements. Terraform configuration exists but deployment needs execution and validation."

			"taskTitle": "Cron Job Implementation and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize cron job implementation as: 1) Deploy process-reminders function to production, 2) Configure Cloud Scheduler with multiple reminder intervals, 3) Implement secret disclosure automation for missed deadlines, 4) Add monitoring and alerting for cron job failures, 5) Implement dead letter queue for failed notifications, 6) Add admin dashboard for cron job monitoring",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving critical automation, multiple timing intervals, and failure handling. Google Cloud Scheduler configuration exists but function deployment and monitoring incomplete."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "SMS Reminder Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure SMS implementation as: 1) Integrate Twilio API for SMS sending, 2) Update contact methods to support SMS preferences, 3) Implement SMS templates for reminders and notifications, 4) Add phone number verification flow, 5) Update reminder processing for multi-channel delivery, 6) Add SMS delivery tracking and compliance handling",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with third-party API integration, user preference management, and compliance requirements. SMS configuration needed and some SMS code present in process-reminders function."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Security Audit and Penetration Testing",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure security audit as: 1) Third-party audit of Shamir's Secret Sharing implementation, 2) Penetration testing of authentication and authorization, 3) API endpoint vulnerability assessment, 4) Review data encryption at rest and in transit, 5) Audit secret storage and reconstruction processes, 6) Review session management and token security, 7) Input validation and SQL injection assessment, 8) Client-side encryption implementation review",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to comprehensive security requirements, third-party audit coordination, and critical cryptographic implementation validation. Security is paramount for a dead man's switch service."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize performance optimization as: 1) Set up APM monitoring (New Relic/DataDog), 2) Implement performance budgets and monitoring, 3) Optimize database queries with proper indexing, 4) Implement caching strategies for static content, 5) Add real-time uptime monitoring and alerting, 6) Optimize Next.js build and loading performance, 7) Load testing for target user capacity",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving multiple monitoring tools, database optimization, and load testing. Performance critical for user experience but requires comprehensive tooling integration."
