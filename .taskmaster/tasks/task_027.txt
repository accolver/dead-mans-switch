# Task ID: 27
# Title: Create Authorization Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive tests to validate the authorization layer and ensure no unauthorized access is possible
# Details:
Create comprehensive test suite in __tests__/auth/authorization-security.test.ts to verify authorization middleware. Test scenarios: cross-user secret access attempts, unauthorized API calls, admin-only endpoint protection, and session hijacking prevention. Use Jest/Vitest to mock different user contexts and verify proper rejection of unauthorized requests.

# Test Strategy:
Security-focused testing with penetration testing mindset. Test boundary conditions, edge cases, and potential attack vectors. Verify all protected endpoints properly validate user ownership and reject unauthorized access attempts.
