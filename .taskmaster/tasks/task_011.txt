# Title: Fix Google Cloud Scheduler cron authentication issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Deploy the cron authentication fix to production Cloud Run environment where CRON_SECRET environment variable is not available despite correct infrastructure configuration.
# Details:
Root cause identified and local fix implemented: CRON_SECRET environment variable not available in production Cloud Run despite correct Terraform infrastructure (frontend.tf line 190, cron.tf secret generation). Local testing with comprehensive debugging shows authentication works perfectly - both /api/cron/process-reminders and /api/cron/check-secrets return 200 OK with proper Bearer token authentication. Security confirmed working - invalid tokens rejected with 401. Issue is deployment-specific: Cloud Run service needs redeployment to pick up latest environment configuration. Infrastructure validation shows: 1) cron.tf generates CRON_SECRET and stores in Secret Manager, 2) frontend.tf line 190 includes CRON_SECRET in env_from_key section, 3) Cloud Scheduler jobs send Bearer token in Authorization header, 4) Service accounts have proper IAM permissions. Comprehensive debugging added to middleware.ts validateCronAuth() function and both cron endpoint route.ts files. Created CRON_AUTH_FIX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with complete deployment procedures and troubleshooting steps.

# Test Strategy:
1) Use validate-cron-endpoints.js script to test production deployment with actual CRON_SECRET from Secret Manager, 2) Verify Cloud Run logs show CRON_SECRET environment variable present and authentication debugging output, 3) Test Google Cloud Scheduler job execution to ensure successful cron calls return 200 OK, 4) Confirm middleware logs show successful token validation for cron routes, 5) Validate security by testing both invalid tokens and no-token requests return 401 Unauthorized, 6) Monitor Cloud Run service environment variables to confirm CRON_SECRET is accessible

# Subtasks:
## 1. Redeploy Cloud Run service with latest environment configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deploy the debugged application to staging/production to pick up CRON_SECRET environment variable from Secret Manager
### Details:
Execute terragrunt apply in infrastructure/terragrunt/staging to trigger Cloud Run service rebuild and deployment with latest environment configuration including CRON_SECRET access from Secret Manager

## 2. Verify CRON_SECRET availability in Cloud Run environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Confirm CRON_SECRET environment variable is accessible in deployed Cloud Run service
### Details:
Use gcloud commands to inspect Cloud Run service environment variables and verify CRON_SECRET is properly loaded from Secret Manager with correct IAM permissions

## 3. Test production cron endpoints with validation script [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Execute validate-cron-endpoints.js against deployed environment to verify authentication works
### Details:
Run CRON_SECRET='actual-secret' NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL='https://staging.keyfate.com' node validate-cron-endpoints.js staging to confirm both endpoints return 200 OK with proper authentication

## 4. Verify Google Cloud Scheduler job execution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test that actual Cloud Scheduler jobs can successfully authenticate and call cron endpoints
### Details:
Manually trigger Cloud Scheduler jobs and verify they execute successfully with 200 status codes, check scheduler logs for any authentication failures

## 5. Monitor and validate deployment success [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Confirm all cron authentication issues are resolved through log analysis and endpoint monitoring
### Details:
Review Cloud Run logs for successful CRON_SECRET loading and token validation, ensure no more 'Invalid cron authentication' errors occur, validate automatic scheduler execution works correctly
