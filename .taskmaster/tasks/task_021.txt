# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement email operation retry logic and failure recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff and failure recovery for email operations
# Details:
Implement sophisticated retry logic for failed email operations: exponential backoff with jitter, configurable retry limits per email type, dead letter queue for permanently failed emails, automatic retry scheduling for transient failures, manual retry capability for admin intervention. Ensure zero data loss with proper logging and state tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Retry logic tests with simulated failures, exponential backoff timing tests, dead letter queue tests, state persistence tests, manual retry functionality tests
