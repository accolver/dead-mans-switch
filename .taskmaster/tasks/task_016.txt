# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement process-reminders cron job with email functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance process-reminders endpoint to decrypt server shares and send disclosure emails to recipients
# Details:
Enhance `/frontend/src/app/api/cron/process-reminders/route.ts` to: query overdue secrets (status='active', next_check_in < now), decrypt server share using existing crypto utilities, send disclosure emails using sendSecretDisclosureEmail() from templates, log operations to email_failures table, implement retry logic with exponential backoff, send admin notifications on failures to support@aviat.io, update secret status to 'triggered' after successful delivery.

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end tests with mock secrets and contacts, crypto decryption tests, email delivery tests, failure handling and retry tests, database state validation tests
