# Title: Implement check-secrets cron job with reminder functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance check-secrets endpoint to calculate urgency and send reminder emails with check-in URLs
# Details:
Enhance `/frontend/src/app/api/cron/check-secrets/route.ts` to: query secrets needing check-in reminders, calculate urgency level based on time remaining (low/medium/high/critical), send reminder emails using sendReminderEmail() with check-in URL, support multiple reminder intervals (25%, 50%, 7d, 3d, 24h, 12h, 1h), log reminder operations to database, implement failure handling with retry logic.

# Test Strategy:
Urgency calculation tests, reminder interval logic tests, email delivery tests, check-in URL generation tests, failure and retry scenario tests
