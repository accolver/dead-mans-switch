# Description: Design and implement provider-agnostic email infrastructure with EmailProvider interface and factory for provider selection
# Details:
Create `/frontend/src/lib/email/providers/` directory with EmailProvider interface. Implement factory pattern in `/frontend/src/lib/email/email-factory.ts` to instantiate providers based on EMAIL_PROVIDER env var. Design interface with sendEmail() method and standardized result format. Leverage existing email-service.ts patterns and support for SendGrid and Mock providers.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for EmailProvider interface compliance, factory instantiation tests with different env vars, mock provider validation tests
