# Task ID: 3
# Title: Complete Stripe and BTCPay Webhook Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Finalize webhook handling and subscription lifecycle management for both payment providers
# Details:
Payment system is partially implemented but needs completion. Tasks: 1) Complete Stripe webhook handlers for all subscription events (created, updated, deleted, payment failed), 2) Implement BTCPay webhook processing for Bitcoin payments, 3) Add subscription status synchronization with database, 4) Implement proper error handling and retry logic for failed webhooks, 5) Add webhook signature verification, 6) Update user tier management based on payment events, 7) Handle edge cases like partial payments, refunds, chargebacks.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with webhook simulators, unit tests for payment event handlers, E2E tests for complete payment flows, security tests for webhook verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Complete Stripe webhook handlers for all subscription events [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive Stripe webhook handlers for subscription lifecycle events including created, updated, deleted, and payment failed
### Details:
Create webhook endpoints and handlers for all Stripe subscription events: customer.subscription.created, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted, invoice.payment_failed, invoice.payment_succeeded. Ensure proper event processing and database updates for subscription status changes.

## 2. Implement BTCPay webhook processing for Bitcoin payments [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build BTCPay Server webhook integration to handle Bitcoin payment notifications and status updates
### Details:
Implement BTCPay webhook endpoints to process Bitcoin payment events including payment received, confirmed, expired, and settled. Handle BTCPay-specific event structure and update subscription status accordingly for Bitcoin payments.

## 3. Add subscription status synchronization with database [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement bidirectional sync between payment provider webhook events and local subscription database
### Details:
Create subscription status sync logic to ensure database reflects current payment provider state. Handle subscription activation, cancellation, renewal, and suspension states. Include conflict resolution for simultaneous updates from different sources.

## 4. Implement webhook signature verification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add security validation for incoming webhook requests from both Stripe and BTCPay
### Details:
Implement webhook signature verification using Stripe's webhook signatures and BTCPay's security headers. Validate incoming requests to prevent unauthorized webhook calls and ensure request authenticity. Add proper error handling for invalid signatures.

## 5. Add error handling and retry logic for failed webhooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Implement robust error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms for webhook processing failures
### Details:
Create comprehensive error handling for webhook failures including network timeouts, database errors, and malformed payloads. Implement exponential backoff retry logic, dead letter queues for persistent failures, and detailed logging for debugging webhook issues.

## 6. Update user tier management based on payment events [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement automatic user tier updates triggered by subscription payment events
### Details:
Create logic to automatically update user tiers and permissions based on subscription status changes. Handle tier upgrades, downgrades, and access revocation based on payment success/failure events. Include grace periods for failed payments.

## 7. Handle edge cases for partial payments, refunds, and chargebacks [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5, 3.6
### Description: Implement comprehensive handling of complex payment scenarios and dispute resolution
### Details:
Handle edge cases including partial payments, prorated refunds, subscription chargebacks, and disputed transactions. Implement proper subscription status updates for these scenarios, including temporary suspension for disputes and reactivation after resolution.
