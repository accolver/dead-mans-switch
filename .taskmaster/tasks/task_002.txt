# Title: Production SMTP Configuration and Email Delivery Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure production-ready SMTP service for reliable email delivery of reminders and notifications
# Details:
Current email system needs production SMTP configuration. Implement: 1) Configure SMTP provider (SendGrid/Mailgun/AWS SES) for direct email sending, 2) Create custom email templates for reminders, check-ins, and notifications in the application, 3) Implement email delivery monitoring and retry logic, 4) Set up email authentication (SPF/DKIM), 5) Handle bounce/complaint processing via SMTP provider webhooks, 6) Implement batch email processing without Supabase limitations. This is critical for core functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for SMTP delivery, unit tests for email templates, load testing for batch email processing, monitoring tests for delivery failures
