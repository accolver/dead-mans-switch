# Task ID: 1
# Title: Complete Email Verification System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix Google OAuth email verification and implement complete email verification workflow with OTP
# Details:
The current system shows email verification is not working properly with NextAuth. Need to: 1) Configure email verification for NextAuth system, 2) Fix Google OAuth flow in NextAuth to properly handle email verification, 3) Update auth middleware to enforce email verification, 4) Add email verification UI components and flows, 5) Test both Google OAuth and email/password verification flows. This blocks user onboarding and security.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for verification components, integration tests for auth flows, E2E tests for complete verification journey from signup to verified state

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Email Verification for NextAuth System [cancelled]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up email verification workflow for NextAuth-based authentication system
### Details:
Configure email verification for NextAuth authentication. Set up email verification flow with tokens/links, create custom email templates for verification emails, configure SMTP settings for direct email delivery (not through Supabase), and set appropriate verification timeouts and retry limits.

## 2. Fix Google OAuth Email Verification in NextAuth [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update NextAuth Google OAuth flow to properly handle email verification status
### Details:
Fix NextAuth Google OAuth implementation to properly set email verification status in the database. Ensure Google OAuth users are automatically marked as email verified in the user table, update session to reflect verification status, and handle edge cases for existing users.

## 3. Update Authentication Middleware to Enforce Email Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Modify auth middleware to check email verification status and redirect unverified users
### Details:
Update existing auth middleware to check user.meta.email_verified status, implement proper redirects for unverified users, create verification enforcement logic, and ensure protected routes require verified email addresses.

## 4. Create Email Verification UI Components and User Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Develop frontend components for email verification process including verification pages and user feedback
### Details:
Create email verification page component, implement OTP input form, design resend verification email functionality, add user feedback for verification status, create verification success/error states, and ensure responsive design across devices.

## 5. Implement Email Verification Status Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Add backend logic for managing email verification state and handling verification events
### Details:
Implement API endpoints for verification status checks, handle OTP validation logic, manage verification state transitions, implement verification token management, add proper error handling for verification failures, and ensure secure verification process.

## 6. Add Comprehensive Testing for All Verification Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Create complete test suite covering email verification, Google OAuth, and all verification scenarios
### Details:
Write unit tests for verification components and logic, create integration tests for email/password and Google OAuth flows, implement E2E tests for complete verification journey, test edge cases and error scenarios, add performance tests for email delivery, and ensure test coverage meets quality standards.
