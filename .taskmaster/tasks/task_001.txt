# Task ID: 1
# Title: Complete Email Verification System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix Google OAuth email verification and implement complete email verification workflow with OTP
# Details:
The current system shows email verification is not working (user.meta.email_verified not set to true). Need to: 1) Enable email verification with OTP in Supabase settings, 2) Fix Google OAuth flow to properly set email_verified flag, 3) Update auth middleware to enforce email verification, 4) Add email verification UI components and flows, 5) Test both Google OAuth and email/password verification flows. This blocks user onboarding and security.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for verification components, integration tests for auth flows, E2E tests for complete verification journey from signup to verified state

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Supabase Email Settings and OTP Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable email verification with OTP in Supabase settings and configure email authentication templates
### Details:
Configure Supabase Auth settings to enable email verification, set up OTP verification flow, customize email templates for verification emails, configure SMTP settings for email delivery, and set appropriate verification timeouts and retry limits.

## 2. Fix Google OAuth Email Verification Flag Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Update Google OAuth flow to properly set email_verified flag in user metadata
### Details:
Investigate current Google OAuth implementation, fix the issue where user.meta.email_verified is not being set to true, ensure Google OAuth users are automatically marked as email verified, and handle edge cases for existing users.

## 3. Update Authentication Middleware to Enforce Email Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Modify auth middleware to check email verification status and redirect unverified users
### Details:
Update existing auth middleware to check user.meta.email_verified status, implement proper redirects for unverified users, create verification enforcement logic, and ensure protected routes require verified email addresses.

## 4. Create Email Verification UI Components and User Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Develop frontend components for email verification process including verification pages and user feedback
### Details:
Create email verification page component, implement OTP input form, design resend verification email functionality, add user feedback for verification status, create verification success/error states, and ensure responsive design across devices.

## 5. Implement Email Verification Status Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Add backend logic for managing email verification state and handling verification events
### Details:
Implement API endpoints for verification status checks, handle OTP validation logic, manage verification state transitions, implement verification token management, add proper error handling for verification failures, and ensure secure verification process.

## 6. Add Comprehensive Testing for All Verification Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Create complete test suite covering email verification, Google OAuth, and all verification scenarios
### Details:
Write unit tests for verification components and logic, create integration tests for email/password and Google OAuth flows, implement E2E tests for complete verification journey, test edge cases and error scenarios, add performance tests for email delivery, and ensure test coverage meets quality standards.
