# Title: Fix Test Environment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24, 25
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve test environment configuration issues including DATABASE_URL setup and test database isolation
# Details:
Ensure vitest.config.mts DATABASE_URL points to proper test Cloud SQL instance. Implement test database schema isolation or separate test database. Add test environment validation script that verifies all required environment variables. Create test data seeding and cleanup utilities for consistent test environments.

# Test Strategy:
Create test-environment.test.ts to validate test configuration, database connectivity, environment variable presence, and test data isolation. Ensure tests don't interfere with each other or production data.
