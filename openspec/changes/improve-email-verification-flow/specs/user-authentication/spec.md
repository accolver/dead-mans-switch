## MODIFIED Requirements

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Requirement: Comprehensive Sign-Up and Verification Testing

#### Scenario: Sign-up success state test

- **WHEN** test executes sign-up with valid credentials
- **THEN** verification message is displayed
- **AND** message contains user's email address
