# Security Components Rules

## Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)

- Never send raw secrets to server - only encrypted server share
- Use `shamirs-secret-sharing` library for all SSS operations
- Default: N=3 shares, T=2 threshold (2-of-3)
- Support configurable N (2-10) and T (2-N) values

## Secret Handling

- Raw secrets must only exist in browser memory
- Server share (share[0]) encrypted with AES-256-GCM before transmission
- Use `encryptMessage`/`decryptMessage` from `lib/encryption.ts`

## Component Requirements

- SSS operations must be client-side only
- Add clear warnings before revealing server shares
- Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Share Management UI

- Display share[1] as "Your Personal Share"
- Display share[2] as "Primary Recipient's Share"
- Provide copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Require confirmation before proceeding
