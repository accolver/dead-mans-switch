# Testing Standards

## Testing Requirements
- All new features must include unit tests
- Test security-critical components thoroughly
- Mock external dependencies (Supabase, crypto APIs)

## Test Organization
- **Utility Functions**: encryption, utils, env validation
- **Database Integration**: connection and query functions
- **React Components**: forms, buttons, navigation
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI components
- **Custom Hooks**: toast, contact methods

## Security Testing
- Test encryption/decryption functions with known vectors
- Verify SSS share generation and reconstruction
- Test that raw secrets never reach server APIs
- Validate proper error handling for invalid shares

## Test Configuration
- Use Vitest as primary test runner
- Mock Supabase client for consistent test environments
- Suppress expected console errors in tests
- Use proper cleanup in test teardown
